# A Continuous Integration System
 Continuous Integration (CI) systems are dedicated systems used to test new code. Upon a commit to the code repository, it is the responsibility of the continuous integration system to verify that this commit will not break any tests. To do this, the system must be able to fetch the new changes, run the tests and report its results. Like any other system, it should also be failure resistant. This means if any part of the system fails, it should be able to recover and continue from that point.
